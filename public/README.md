## Making my own API

This week, and I cannot stress this enough, was *hell*.

I left last weeks class very stressed because I felt like I had JUST gotten to understand html and css and getting a glimpse to API and now I had to make my own. To give you an idea of where I started, I didn't even understand what the assignment was, how to start, or the purpose of it (what were we trying to learn?).

I came up with an idea to make a "Blockbuster Name Generator" where I can click "generate" and it'll respond something like "*CHARACTER* & the ADJECTIVE *CHARACTER*". But then I realized the we couldn't pull from an existing API, we needed to create one. So I started by following a tutorial step by step. Got confused and restarted. Then I followed The Coding Train tutorial without even attempting to change any of the code and it worked.

After I had that working and connected to my server.js I proceeded to change the information on my character.json and adding through the url path. I managed to add a bunch of characters and the movie they come from.

I got stuck trying to make a front end that had "get" "push" and "delete" buttons to be able to modify my data file.

Right now, nothing much is showing on the client side since I couldn't really connect both together. If you run the url with "/all" you can see what the data file looks like and if you do "/add" you'll be able to add to it.

Even though I got here I don't understand how? The whole thing seems unnecesary with so many APIs available?

##ERROR
I got this error while trying to push to github remotely. I don't understand why it's there now and not before? Super confused.
